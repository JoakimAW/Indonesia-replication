- make_index.ado: this is also from the authors

- Fold output: a folder that will have the different tables

- authors_regressions.do: this is copy-pasted from the authors do files, it just doesn’t include the initial changes of directories.

- psacalc.ado: used by the authors to calculate Oster bounds, got it from https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s457677.html
